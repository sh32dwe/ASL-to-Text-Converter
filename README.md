# ASL to Text Conversion 

## Overview
This project aims to develop a system that converts American Sign Language (ASL) gestures into text using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). The model is trained to recognize and classify images of ASL signs, which include the 26 letters of the alphabet and 10 digits (0-9). The implementation leverages TensorFlow and Keras for building and training the neural network.

## Features
- **Image Classification**: Converts ASL images into corresponding text.
- **Deep Learning Model**: Utilizes a CNN architecture for effective feature extraction.
- **Dataset Management**: Scripts for downloading, splitting, and preparing datasets.
- **Model Evaluation**: Evaluate the model's performance on test data.

## Dataset
The dataset consists of images categorized into 36 classes representing the ASL alphabet and digits. Ensure that the dataset is structured correctly for optimal training results.

## Installation

### Prerequisites
